# Parental Control

To guarantee a safe and appropriate experience for underage users, the account in the MathCA application must be created by an adult (of legal age) responsible for the minor.

This adult must create a parental control password to unlock some of MathCA's features. 
An account with parental controls set has the same functionality as an account without parental controls, with the following exceptions:

- In the app, only the user's username is displayed. 
To access any other personal information, you need to enter parental controls.


- In the app, only the user's username is displayed. 
To access any other personal information, you need to enter parental controls.


- Purchasing content on MathCA is protected by the parental control password.



Parental controls can be activated and deactivated at any time by the adult responsible for the minor in the application preferences.
