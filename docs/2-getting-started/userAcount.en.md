# User Account

MathCA user accounts play a critical role in providing a personalized and versatile app experience.

Some of the advantages of having a MathCA user account are:

-  **Save Preferences:**  With a user account, you can customize your experience to your liking, save your preferences and settings, sync content, and pick up right where you left off.


-  **Buy Content:**  As a member, you have the option to purchase premium content, such as new recipes and cookbook chapters.


-  **Device Sync:**  With one user account, you can sync your recipes, shopping lists, and preferences across multiple devices. This allows you to access your information anytime, anywhere.



You can create a MathcCA account from the home screen if this is the first time you're launching the app on your device, or from the app's preferences if you're using the "Try without signing up" mode.

## Password recovery

If you forget your password, MathCA allows you to recover it securely. 
Simply select the “recover password” option on the login screen and follow the instructions.

## Sign Out or Delete Account

If at any time you would like to sign out of your account or permanently delete it, you can also do so from your profile settings in the app.
