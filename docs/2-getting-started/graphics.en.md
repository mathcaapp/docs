# Interactive

MathCA is not only a culinary tool; 
It is also a space where you can explore and learn mathematics in a visual and entertaining way. 
MathCA application includes drop-downs, dynamic questions and interactive graphics in 2D and 3D, you will be able to explore these concepts in a dynamic and participatory way.

## Dropdowns and Dynamic Questions

Dynamic questions with which to learn interactively.

## 2D graphics

Our 2D graphs give you a detailed view of mathematical functions and data on a two-dimensional plane. 
This is ideal for visualizing functions, representing data, and understanding mathematical concepts effectively.

## 3D graphics

3D graphics allow you to dynamically explore three-dimensional objects and equations. 
These graphics can be rotated to change the point of view and make it easier to understand three-dimensional shapes and mathematical objects.
