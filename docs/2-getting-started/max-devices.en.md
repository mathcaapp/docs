# Linked Device Limit

It is important to note that MathCA has a limitation of a maximum of 5 devices simultaneously linked to an account. 
This means that you will be able to access your account from a maximum of 5 different devices at the same time.

With MathCA, you have the flexibility to log out of any device associated with your account from the “devices” preferences section. 
If you exceed the limit of allowed devices, MathCA will present you with a screen that will allow you to easily unlink any device associated with your account.

{: .warning}
>  When you sign in on a new device, your session on other devices may be automatically updated. 
>  This may result in a redirection of the current screen and as a result you may experience a momentary interruption in your activity.
